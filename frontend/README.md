# AdaptiveTest Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Mock Mode
The home page currently uses a mocked report so you can see the UI immediately.
- To connect to your backend, edit `pages/index.jsx` and set `MOCK_MODE = false`.
- Optionally, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in `.env.local` to point to your FastAPI.

## Assets
Replace the SVG placeholders in `public/assets/images/` with your real images.
Replace `public/assets/lottie/scanning.json` with your real Lottie JSON.
